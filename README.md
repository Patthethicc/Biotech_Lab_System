<h2>frontend</h2>
1. `flutter run` on the frontend repo <br>
2. `flutter test` to test all function <br>
3. not sure if this applies to all, but i'll just put it here `flutter run -t lib/models/ui/main.dart`

<h2>backend</h2>
1. need endpoints to connect front and backend <br>
2. entities (model) are now implemented
<br>
note: lis is backend

<h2>Notes for this branch</h2>
1. API url in new_user_service.dart is in localhost for testing, NOT yet connected to DB. <br>
2. Added intl dependency in the pubscpec.yaml file (for date time) <br>
3. Examples are hard coded for now, no CRUD operations with db yet <br>
4. 'Add entry' button doesn't do anything for now <br>
